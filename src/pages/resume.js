                     <p>In my four year tenure at Spiceworks, there has been no short of work that I haven't done. Still in it's infancy, the then startup necessitated for me to get scrappy and get things done. Worked on everything from event branding for a 2,500+ annual conference, identity work on sub brands for the company, then eventually shifted focus to the digital design domain. It was in that space that I was responsible for art direction, planning and implementation of data research solution products. Was the lead designer on crafting an internet resource hub of all of the online publications for Spiceworks.</p>
